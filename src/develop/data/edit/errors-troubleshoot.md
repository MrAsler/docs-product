# Fixing issues

While editing data in Service Studio, issues may arise in the following moments:

Editing a cell with an entity identifier or static entity identifier
:   In a few cases Service Studio isn't able to show you suggestions for cells that use foreign keys to other entities or static entities.<br/>Service Studio tells you the cause of the issue.
Even without suggestions, you can still edit the value of these cells, but [issues may occur while trying to apply the change]().

Before applying pending changes
:   Service Studio continually validates your pending changes, and highlights cells with a red outline if it detects an issue.<br/>
Hovering over the highlighted cell gives you details on issues and how to fix them. You must solve these issues before applying the changes to the database.

After failing to apply a change
:   Some issues can only be detected while trying to apply your changes to the database. <br/>
Service Studio let's you know about these issues by showing an error message and highlighting the rows with changes that couldn't be apllied in the database.
