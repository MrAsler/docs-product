# How Integration Builder works

Integration Builder is a Software as a Service (SaaS) tool that connects to your OutSystems environment.

Integration Builder generates **integrations** for different external systems according to the configuration you provide. Each integration needs an associated **connection** that specifies the authentication used in runtime by the integration in an OutSystems environment.

After creating an integration and setting up a connection, use Service Studio to add calls to the Service Actions provided by the integration in your OutSystems apps.

## Architecture overview { #architecture }

![Integration Builder architecture diagram](images/architecture-diag.png?width=800)

The main components involved in the Integration Builder architecture are the following:

* **Integration Builder** generates integrations that connect to external systems and publishes them to your OutSystems environment.

* **Integration Manager** is an OutSystems application that Integration Builder publishes to your OutSystems environment when you publish an integration. It manages connections and their association with integrations.  
    Integration Manager communicates with Integration Builder to keep the status of integrations consistent and to get initial integration configurations.

* An **integration** is an OutSystems application generated by Integration Builder containing Server Actions to interact with an external system, according to the configurations you provide. Learn more about the [structure of generated integrations](structure.md).

* A **connection** is where you define the credentials or the type of authentication used in runtime to connect with an external system. Connections are defined in each OutSystems environment.  
    Different external systems offer different ways of integrating with them. While some external systems support a basic authentication mechanism like Basic Authentication, other systems implement more complex authentication flows like OAuth.  

* End users access an **OutSystems app** that you developed and published on your environment. This app calls Service Actions exposed by the integration to interact with the external system.

## Users

Integration Builder authenticates IT users by contacting your environment to validate the user credentials.

To use Integration Builder you must have an [IT user](../../managing-the-applications-lifecycle/manage-it-teams/intro.md) that has the [correct permissions](set-up.md#prerequisites) for the environment.

All IT users in your infrastructure that have these permissions can access and edit all integrations created and managed by Integration Builder.

Every OutSystems developer that can create applications in an OutSystems environment enrolled in the  program can log in to Integration Builder. Every developer can see and modify all integrations created and managed by Integration Builder.

During the EAP, OutSystems must authorize your OutSystems environment in advance before any IT users of your infrastructure can log in.
