# Harden the protection of mobile apps with AppShield

OutSystems AppShield is a licensed plugin available from Forge. AppShield lets you harden the protection of your native Android and iOS apps. AppShield integrates with the Mobile Apps Build Service (MABS) version 6.3 and adds app protection at runtime and at rest.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

To use OutSystems AppShield, you must have a license. If you don't already have a license, contact the sales team.

</div>

By using AppShield, you can prevent:

* Code from being injected into your app
* Users from taking screenshots of the data
* Data from being hijacked 

Before you install and use AppShield, it's important to understand the release cycle and how it improves security. For example, suppose you have a mobile banking application and your app data must always be secure, but your version of AppShield isn't current. OutSystems regularly updates AppShield, and strongly recommends that you always install the latest version of AppShield in your environment. Then release a new build of your app to your users.

To ensure your app users have protection against the latest security vulnerabilities, OutSystems provides continuous updates to AppShield.

## Understanding the AppShield life cycle

To identify the AppShield plugin releases, OutSystems uses the following tags:

* Stable 
* Current
* Expiring
* Discontinued

The following list describes the tags:

* **Stable and Current** - This is the active version and has the up-to-date protection. OutSystems **supports** this version and highly recommends that you install and use this version.
* **Stable** - You can use this version, but the protection isn't current. OutSystems **doesn't support** this version. You can build an app, but you get a warning message when you try to build the app.
* **Stable and Expiring** - This version becomes discontinued in three months. OutSystems **doesn't support** this version, but you can build an app with it. If you use this version, a warning message displays advising you to update to the most current version before the expiration date. Once this version is **discontinued**, you won't be able to build your app with it.
* **Discontinued** - This plugin version is out of date. OutSystems security mechanisms prevent you from creating a new build for your users. OutSystems **doesn't support** this version.

The following diagram shows how release versions work in AppShield.

<div class="warning" markdown="1">

To keep your apps and data secure, OutSystems recommends that you always use the current version of the AppShield plugin. Go to the [Versions tab of the plugin Forge page](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-versions/9379) to get the current version. 

</div>

## Prerequisites

To ensure the integrity and protection of your apps with AppShield, you must meet the following requirements.

* You installed the AppShield plugin in your environment. To download the plugin, check out [OutSystems AppShield](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9379/) in Forge. 
* You have a license for AppShield.
* You're using MABS 6.3 or later. Check out [MABS and mobile operating systems life cycles](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service_Versions) for more information about the supported operating systems.
* The OutSystems Platform Server is running on OutSystems 11.

Also note the following:

* You need to rebuild and redistribute the mobile apps protected with AppShield.
* The app file size increases after hardening the security.
* MABS takes more time to create a hardened build.

## Supported features

These are the features you can use with the current release of the AppShield plugin.

### Android

Protection available for the Android builds.

* Root detection
* Repackaging detection
* Code obfuscation
* Code injection protection
* Debugger protection
* Emulator detection
* Key logger protection
* Screen reader detection
* Screenshot protection
* Task hijacking protection

### iOS

Protection available for the iOS builds.

* Jailbreak detection

### Configuration

AppShield is on by default when you install the plugin. You can turn it off in one or more environments for **testing purposes**.

* To turn off AppShield in one or more environments, edit the Extensibility Configuration settings **in LifeTime** for the environment. Disabling the plugin in the development environment, for example, lets you run the app in emulators or debug the app.
  
* To turn off AppShield globally, edit the Extensibility Configuration settings **in Service Studio**. LifeTime copies configuration from Service Studio to other environments during deployment. 

<div class="info" markdown="1">

When working with AppShield JSON for Extensibility Configuration, keep in mind:

* Specific settings in Extensibility Configuration override global Extensibility Configuration settings.
* Extensibility Configuration settings in LifeTime override the Extensibility Configuration in Service Studio.

</div>

Here is an example of the JSON for Extensibility Configurations. You can use different sections for iOS and Android.

```
{
    "preferences": {
        "global": [
            {
                "name": "DisableAppShielding",
                "value": "false"
            },
            {
                "name": "AllowJailbrokenRootedDevices",
                "value": "false"
            }
        ],
        "android": [
            {
                "name": "AllowJailbrokenRootedDevices",
                "value": "true"
            },
            {

            }
        ],
        "ios": [
            {
                "name": "AllowJailbrokenRootedDevices",
                "value": "true"
            },
            {

                "value": "false"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Obfuscation

In the current version, native code from the shell and supported plugins are obfuscated. A crash from an obfuscated code will generate an obfuscated stack trace.

### Considerations

Customized plugins might not work as-is with obfuscation.

One common example is the usage of reflection to perform operations based on class/method names. Since obfuscation changes these names, the code might stop working as expected and even crash. This can occur not only in the Java code in the plugin, but also in the code from the libraries imported via Gradle or JAR/AAR files.

Getting a `ClassNotFoundException` or `MethodNotFoundException` at runtime is a sure sign you're missing classes or methods, either because they were obfuscated and now have other names. Or, they were missing because of some misconfigured dependencies.

Examples of deobfuscated exceptions that can be thrown:

```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.SomeClass
    at java.lang.Class.classForName(Native Method)
    at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:454)
    at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:379)
    ...
```

```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.example.SomeClass" on path: DexPathList[[zip file "/data/app/..., /system/lib, /system_ext/lib]]
    at dalvik.system.BaseDexClassLoader.findClass(BaseDexClassLoader.java:207)
    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:379)
    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:312)
    ...
```

```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: com.example.SomeClass.someMethod [class java.lang.String, int]
    at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:2072)
    at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1693)
    ...
```

```
java.lang.AssertionError: illegal type variable reference
    at libcore.reflect.TypeVariableImpl.resolve(TypeVariableImpl.java:111)
    at libcore.reflect.TypeVariableImpl.getGenericDeclaration(TypeVariableImpl.java:125)
    at libcore.reflect.TypeVariableImpl.hashCode(TypeVariableImpl.java:47)
    at com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken.[init](TypeToken.java:64)
    ...
```

## Performance

When the user launches a hardened app, the app performs multiple checks. Some examples of these checks are the root and repackaging detection. This makes the app take slightly more time to launch, especially when starting for the first time. The time to start varies depending on multiple factors, such as device hardware and the complexity of the app.

## Limitations

AppShield has the following limitations. 

### General

Non-specific limitations.

* On iOS the plugin doesn't block user-initiated screenshots, it only notifies the app that a screenshot was taken. OutSystems currently doesn't support this event. However, AppShield blocks taking screenshots of the iOS App Switcher.

* After MABS creates a build with the AppShield plugin active, and signs the build, you can't sign that build again manually because the app would recognize that as a sign of tampering.

### Obfuscation

The limitations that are specific to the obfuscation.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

We know how important obfuscation of JavaScript is to our customers. Our development team is working hard on delivering JavaScript obfuscation in one of the upcoming versions of AppShield.

</div>

* The plugin obfuscates only the supported OutSystems mobile plugins.
* The plugin obfuscates native Android logs in Service Center. You need to use an external tool to deobfuscate the logs.
* JavaScript files obfuscation isn't supported. OutSystems provides guidance to obfuscate JavaScript.
* Native iOS bitcode obfuscation isn't supported.
* You need to contact Support to get the mapping files.


## How to retrace Android obfuscated logs

The purpose of the obfuscation is to make the app harder to reverse-engineer. During the obfuscation process, the platform creates a mapping with the old and new names of methods and classes.

In an obfuscated app, an error stack trace might look like this:

![Obfuscation example](images/obfuscated.png?width=600)

**Prerequisites**

These are the prerequisites to deobfuscate the logs.

* Android Studio on Mac, Linux, or Windows.
* The mapping.txt file from the build. Please reach Support and request the mapping file. 
* A stack trace to deobfuscate and retrace.

**Steps**

1. Have the mapping file ready.
1. Locate the proguard tools, located under your Android SDK folder, usually in `$ANDROID_HOME/tools/proguard/bin`.
1. Inside, you should have the retrace cli, or the proguardgui.

    With **retrace cli**. Use the retrace command, followed by the path to the mapping file and the file with the stack trace. Or, run the command without the stack trace file and then paste the log content. 

    With **proguardgui**. Click the **ReTrace** button in the left pane and locate your mapping file. Paste the obfuscated stack trace and click **ReTrace!**.

    ![Proguard UI](images/proguard-log.png?width=600) 

<div class="warning" markdown="1>

The lines for the purposes of parsing can't have the timestamp, which is what logcat tools usually produce. Instead, the lines must start with the **at** keyword.

</div>

## Google Play App Signing

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Applies to apps for Google Play Store that have app signing feature enabled.

</div>

One of the security features of AppShield is repackaging detection. This protection prevents re-signing of the app package, but also causes incompatibility with the Google Play App Signing. You can fix this by providing information about the certificate in the AppShield settings.

In the **Android section** of the Extensibility Configurations JSON, add a preference item with `GooglePlayAppSigningCertificate` as its **name** and the public key as its **value**. Here is an example:


```
{
    "preferences": {
        "android": [
            {
                "name": "GooglePlayAppSigningCertificate",
                "value": "[public-key-certificate]"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

To get the values for **[public-key-certificate]**, do the following:

1. From Google Play Console download the **App Signing Certificate** available in the **App Signing** fragment.

2. Convert the **.der** file to **.pem** by running the command `openssl x509 -inform der -in deployment_cert.der -out certificate.pem`. You should now have **certificate.pem**.

3. Open the **certificate.pem** file in a text editor and copy the content between **-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-** and **-END CERTIFICATE-**.

After these changes steps, generate **a new build** of your mobile app.

<div class="warning" markdown="1">

If you generate an app in MABS with Play App Signing on, you need to sign the app via Google Play before you install it on your device. An unsigned app won't work, even if you install it by running the installer directly on the device.

</div>
